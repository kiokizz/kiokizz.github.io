"Only 1 card in Splinterlands exists as a unique, single copy: the gold foil Mighty Dricken. If you spot it on the battlefield, you'll have a lot of luck that day. Whether that luck will be good or bad—well, that remains to be seen. ⁠—goldmatters"

"Sneak, Snipe, and Opportunity are great for taking out your opponent's back row, but be careful about spreading your damage too thin. ⁠—davel22"

Sometimes the easiest way to win is to outlast your enemy.
"Sometimes when a card's level increases and it gains a new ability, some of its stats decrease."
"Sometimes with enough healing, you need very little attack to pull off a win. Sometimes none at all will do the trick."
